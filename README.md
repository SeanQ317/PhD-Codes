# PhD-Codes
Selection of codes used in PhD

These are a selection of the codes I (Sean Quinn) have written/edited/used throughout my PhD where I reseaerced sunquakes (SQs) in the solar atmosphere.

They are written in IDL, and are not exactly 'neat'. Some have ben written to run for only one event, some have been written for more general events. A lot of the data that has been used for these prjects is not open access, so the codes may not make sense.

These codes have been written for use of inout CRISPEX files from CRISP at the Swedish Solar Telescope (SST) or HMI/LOS or AIA 1600/1700 from the SDO.

Some have been written for more general use, with an input FITS file.
